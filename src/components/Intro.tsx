        Fashion is more than just clothing—it&apos;s a statement, a creative
        expression, and a reflection of the vibrant energy of our community.
        This year&rsquo;s show&rsquo;s theme,”Street Couture,” embodies the raw
        authenticity and individuality of the Buffalo streets, elevated to the
        realm of high fashion. It&rsquo;s embraces the pulse of the city, where
        sidewalks become runways and every corner is a stage.
