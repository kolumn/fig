I participated in BAM’s single look show and BSU’s RUNWAY in 2023 and after that I knew that this is what I’ll be doing until I can’t anymore.</p>',

    bio: "<p>Fashion is not just about appearance, but rather an expressive art form that allows individuals to showcase their inner selves to the world. I specialize in creating custom hats, leather goods, and stylish clothing. What particularly intrigues me is the use of recycled materials, as I continuously discover innovative ways to breathe new life into them. Every piece I craft is meticulously done with the intent of becoming an extension of a client's identity, capturing their essence, personal style, and character. Hailing from Buffalo, New York, I found my passion for leather craftsmanship early on. My journey led me to Europe, where I immersed myself in the rich tradition of European leatherworking, honing my skills and expanding my knowledge. Additionally, I've enriched my education by taking classes at Parsons School of Design and studying at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), further refining my craft and understanding of fashion. Now, blending the heritage of European craftsmanship with my own unique style, I aim to create pieces that not only stand out but also tell a story of artistry and dedication.</p>",

    bio: '<p>My name is Robby Motz.</p><p>Fashion has always dominated my life. Growing up about 30 minutes from the city of Buffalo, in a small country town called Alden, I was always looking for ways to stand out from the typical crowd. One of the best discoveries I made was when my closest friend introduced me to skateboarding. The best part about skating to me was that it wasn’t only about what tricks you could do or how well you could ride a board, instead it was about the real sense of community within the skate world. Being a part of this community inspired me to start the company you see today as Plain Only Clothing.</p><p>Mid 2020 Plain Only had officially started as a skateboarding brand. With a colorful embroidered PLAIN logo on the front of different colored blank t-shirts. As time went on I had come to the realization that I had bigger plans. The t-shirts were a great introduction but I felt that I had much more to offer and much more creativity to put on display.</p><p>Fashion is my escape. It is what keeps me grounded. All of the pieces I create all speak to who I am and all have a story and feeling behind it. I feel that I still have lots to learn and even more to experience, but that’s what keeps me going. I am blessed to be put in the position I’m in and I will keep working in hopes that one day I can inspire and help put people into the same position.</p>',
